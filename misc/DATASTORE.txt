Notes:
For every instance of IDENTIFIERS below, two sets of IDs are implied. PRIMARY_ID 
will always be present. EXTERNAL_ID may not be present, but will be stored as 
dictionaries if present with namespace as keys
	PRIMARY_ID			# SRP, SRX, SRS, SRR
	EXTERNAL_ID			# GSM, GSE etc

For every instance of _ATTRIBUTE below, tag and values are implied. To be stored
as dictionaries with TAG as keys
	TAG 
	VALUE
